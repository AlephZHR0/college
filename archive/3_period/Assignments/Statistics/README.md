# Objectives of the analysis
This entire analisys was made for a college assignment. presenting to the class the logistic regression model and how it works.
In the presentation we presented some other concepts that are relevant to the logistic regression model, such as the ROC curve, AUC, and the confusion matrix.

# Code description
This code performs logistic regression on a credit dataset to predict whether a person is a good or bad credit risk. It reads in the dataset, removes missing values, converts the 'Status' column to binary, creates dummy variables for categorical columns, defines the X and Y variables, performs logistic regression, and outputs the accuracy score and ROC curve. The best accuracy achieved is printed at the end.

# Results
The results of the analysis are available in the following presentation:
